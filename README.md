One of the key problems that causes incidents such as sideswiping is bus bunching. One one hand, clumps of bus creates a long waiting times for buses to arrive a particular terminal while on the other hand, due to the half-fixed- half-performance based salary scheme of PUV drivers today, these buses will try to battle other buses for commuters which increases incident rates all over the metro.
